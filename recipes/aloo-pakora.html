    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Pakoras are the Pakistani version of a fritter, but made with <em>besan</em> (chickpea flour in English).Similar to potato fritters, aloo pakora are a traditional Pakistani 
        appetizer of sliced potatoes that are coated with a spicy chickpea flour batter and deep-fried till golden brown. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup chickpea flour</li>
        <li>1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon tumeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon coriander seeds, crushed (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pomegranate seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>2 large potatoes</li>
        <li>Water to make the batter</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
        <li>Chaat masala for garnish</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the besan / chickpea flour in a bowl. Add red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, salt and 
            coriander seeds or pomegranate seeds if using. Mix well with a fork.</li>
        <li>Add water (1/4 cup at a time) to create a batter, and set aside for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Wash and peel the potatoes. Thinly slice them with a knife. You can use a mandolin, but just make sure the 
            potato slices aren't too thin. They should be thicker than a potato chip, but not too thick otherwise they won't cook from inside.</li>
        <li>Dip a sliced potato in the batter to check the batter consistency. It should coat the potatoes completely, but not be too thick otherwise 
            the pakoras will be more batter and less about the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a karahi, wok, or deep frying pan.</li>
        <li>Dip the sliced potatoes in the batter making sure to coat completely. Add to the hot oil. Cook on low - medium flame till the potatoes are 
            golden brown on the outside (they will fluff up) and cooked through from inside.</li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon to remove the pakoras, and drain on kitchen towel to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chaat masala, and serve hot with chutney and ketchup on the side.</li>
      </ol>
