        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500 grams chicken mince / qeema</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
            <li>few drops of oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon roasted cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes</li>
            <li>3 - 4 onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups coriander, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 green chili, sliced</li>
            <li>40 - 50 samosa patti or spring roll wrappers, cut into required size</li>
            <li>4 - 5 tablespoon flour</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the mince and water (about 1 1/2 cups - 2 cups) in a saucepan.</li>
            <li>Add salt, red chili powder, ginger paste, garlic paste, coriander powder, and a few drops of oil.</li>
            <li>Bring the mince to a boil, and cook until water is evaporated and mince is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Take out the mince in a large bowl, and set it aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Add roasted cumin seeds, garam masala, and red chili flakes o the cooked mince and mix well. At this point, the mince mixture can be kept in the freezer, if needed.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, coriander, and green chili and mix through.</li>
            <li>Mix flour and water in a small bowl to make a thick paste.</li>
            <li>Fill the samosa patti with the mince mixture(about 1 - 2 teaspoon of the filling), and fold it into a triangular shape using the sticky flour mixture to glue it shut.</li>
            <li>The samosa can be fried off right away, or frozen to use another day.</li>
            <li>To freeze, place the samosas on a tray making sure they don't touch each other. Keep the tray in the freezer for about 30 - 45 minutes till the samosas are frozen. 
                Once the samosas are frozen, they can be removed individually and put in a plastic bag. Spray oil on the tray to make sure the samosas don't stick to the bottom.</li>
            <li>To fry, just take the frozen samosas out of the freezer and place in medium heat oil. Fry till golden brown. Frozen samosas will take 1 - 2 minutes longer to cook compared 
                to fresh samosas.</li>
        </ol>
