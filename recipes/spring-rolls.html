    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic <em>sliced</em></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cup chicken mince or boneless chicken</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups carrots <em>sliced</em></li>
      <li>4 cups cabbage <em>sliced</em></li>
      <li>4 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 - 4 tablespoon vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon sriracha sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
      <li>Spring Roll Wrappers for filling</li>
      <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoon oil. Add sliced garlic followed by ginger paste.</li>
      <li>Add boneless chicken mince and cook for about 10 - 15 minutes till colour changes from pink to white. 
        Use a wooden spoon or spatula to break up the mince while it's cooking.</li>
      <li>Season with a pinch of salt and white pepper.</li>
      <li>Once the chicken mince is cooked, add carrots followed by capsicum. Cook for about a minute and then add the cabbage.</li>
      <li>Add soy sauce, vinegar and sriracha sauce followed by salt and white pepper.</li>
      <li>Cook for about 2 minutes, during which the cabbage will start wilting and reduce in quantity.</li>
      <li>Toss the mixture to make sure the chicken, vegetables and spices get mixed together properly.</li>
      <li>Taste and adjust seasonings, if required.</li>
      <li>Take the filling off the stove, and let it cool down.</li>
      <li>While it cools down, mix flour and water in a small bowl to make a paste that will be used to seal the rolls.</li>
      <li>Carefully peel off one spring roll wrapper. Keep the others covered under a damp tea towel, so that they don't dry out.</li>
      <li>Place the wrapper in a diamond position. Place a very heaped teaspoon of filling on the bottom. Add more filling if you have larger spring roll wrappers. 
        Roll up halfway, fold sides in, then finish rolling. Use the flour paste to seal the edges. 
        Once the spring rolls are prepared, they can be frozen (see note for freezing instructions).</li>
      <li>To make the spring rolls, heat oil in a wok or large frying pan. Heat oil on medium heat and add 3 - 5 spring rolls in the oil and cook, turning occasionally until golden brown. 
        Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a kitchen towel to drain. Continue frying the rest of the spring rolls.</li>
      <li>Serve hot with ketchup, sweet chili sauce, chili garlic sauce or green chutney.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p><strong>Freezing Instructions:</strong> Grease a tray (can be plastic or a baking tray) and lay out the spring rolls one by one on it, making sure there is space between each one of them. 
      Keep them in the freezer for an hour or so till they are partially frozen. Once they are frozen, carefully remove them from the tray and place them in ziplock bags. 
      To make the spring rolls, just take them out of the freezer and deep fry till golden.</p>
