# odin-recipes

<p>View my recipes website using the following link: <a href="https://raafeahmed.github.io/odin-recipes/" target="_blank">Pakistani Recipes</a></p>
I will be creating a recipes webpage using HTML. I hope 
to use all the tools and information that I have learned to create
a basic first webpage. Gain practice writing html boilerplates, using elements and tags, lists, links and images, attributes,
along with following the principles of git commits.
