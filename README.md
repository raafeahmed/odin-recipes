# odin-recipes

View my recipes website using the following link: raafeahmed.github.io/odin-recipes/
I will be creating a recipes webpage using HTML. I hope 
to use all the tools and information that I have learned to create
a basic first webpage. Gain practice writing html boilerplates, using elements and tags, lists, links and images, attributes,
along with following the principles of git commits.
